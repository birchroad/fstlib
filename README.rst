FSTLib
======
Library for communicating with Festo PLC Controllers that support the 
Easy-IP protocol.
Under the src folder you will find different implementations for different
languages like python, ruby and arduino/c++.
The functionality implemented will differ between languages but ip packet
packing and unpacking is a common thing.

Troubleshooting
===============
Under doc/wireshark you can find definition files for dissecting
Easy-IP using Wireshark and "wireshark Generic Dissector"
